# Tribus Crosspost Plugin
The inspiration for this plugin came from this article I found
on the internet from Misha Rudrastyh which you can find [here](https://rudrastyh.com/wordpress-multisite/post-to-all-sites.html#save_post).

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo into your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ page in WordPress Dashboard;
3. Go to _Settings_ â†’ _Tribus Crosspost Settings_ and customize behaviour as needed

## Usage
1. Setup 2 or more sites onto WordPress Multisite network
2. Activate the plugin on the site you want to crosspost from
3. Select the sites on the network you want to crosspost to in the settings
4. Any post created on the main site with the plugin activate will also crosspost the posts to all selected other sites on the network.

#### TODOs:
- _Bug:_ Post terms are sometimes not being copied across sites
- _Improvement:_ Also copy any tags or custom fields
